## Executive Summary
 
For confidentiality purposes we cannot use the real company name, so for this paper we will refer to them as “Company X”. 
 
Company X consists of many bricks and clicks stores specializing in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) space. Our goal is to identify a target audience for Company X in order to execute an effective advertising campaign for the coming year (2016). Our data is from 2015, so for this exercise we will be performing our analysis as if it were 12/31/2015.
It consists of 2.4 million online customer credit card transactions, for about 500,000 customers, for the following segments – dry goods (coffee, tea, sugar and beans), cosmetics, toiletries, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and candy. 
With this data we have identified the most valuable customers by developing a model that will predict the amount of each customer’s next transaction, and developed clusters based on customer spending habits. There is one cluster that exhibits strong consumer loyalty and though they aren’t likely to spend large amounts of money in a single transaction, they will likely make many repeat purchases. This is cluster 3.
 
## Problem Statement

Company X is looking to create targeted advertising campaigns for their primarily online customers. They want to understand their customer spending habits and how much they might spend in their next online purchase. In addition, they would like to gain insights into the demographics of their highest value customers, such as their gender and geographical region.
